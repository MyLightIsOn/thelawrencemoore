            <p>Hello!<p>
            <p>I’m a firm believer in that quote, but I’ll get to that in a bit. I do user experience design, development, and research.  I’ve been doing this for about 8 years and the more I learn, the more I find that my curiosity is limitless.</p>
            <p>I do not take these roles lightly. I was graphic and web designer for many years before becoming a full stack javascript developer.  Now I am focused on quantitative and qualitative research and user experience in general.</p>
            <p>Being a designer and front end dev has given me a unique perspective and allows me to speak everyone’s language as well as get own my hands dirty when conducting UX research.</p>
