For an interaction design job, there were a couple business goals right off the bat that I know I needed to focus on. Some of them include:</p>\r\n                    <ul class=\"process-list\">\r\n                        <li>My website must have interesting interaction elements.</li>\r\n                        <li>I have the dual skillsets of being able to design and write code. I have to show these equally.</li>\r\n                        <li>It must also work on mobile or tablet devices because I won’t know where the people I want to see my site will be when they view it.</li>\r\n                        <li>It has to have color (My last site was cool, but monochromatic).</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/lawrence/slide3.jpg\" alt=\"Screenshot of User Focus.com website\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">After creating my initial goals, I then did some research into a few relevant topics. This would be where I would create use cases for a design. I read several Tech HR articles to see what types of things they look for in designer and developer portfolios.  I also browsed a handful of interaction designer websites to see what others have done. After doing so I added these requirements to my list.</p>\r\n                    <ul class=\"process-list\">\r\n                        <li>Must show design process for several projects.</li>\r\n                        <li>Developed sites need links to live site as well as Github if applicable.</li>\r\n                        <li>Competition is stiff so focus on visual impressions as well as the informative aspects.</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/lawrence/slide4.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe sketch of The Lawrence Moore.com homepage\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">Once I had my design goals set up, it was time to get to work. With the clock ticking, I got out my paper and pencils are started sketching out some interaction concepts.  I needed a good core interaction method that would be visually impressive, but not ridiculously superfluous.</p>\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">I settled on this layout because not only does it have creative interactive functionality, but it also would translate easy between desktop, tablet, and phone. It made room for showcasing both of my skillsets as well.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/lawrence/slide5.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe sketch of The Lawrence Moore.com design page\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">For my design page, I wanted to make room to show all of my projects and the thought process behind as mentioned in my goals. I also did not want to use a lightbox since they can be problematic. I opted to go with a hidden carousel since it would allow me to show and explain my process and also wouldn’t lock the user into one area. They would be free to close it or leave it open and continue browsing at their leisure. And of course, autoplay would NOT be used on the carousel.</p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/lawrence/slide6.jpg\" alt=\"Wireframe prototype of The Lawrence Moore.com homepage\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">Since time was not on my side, I immediately jumped into putting together a prototype. I try to make functional prototypes whenever I can because I believe that letting users test designs in their intended form factor is important.  </p>\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">After user testing my initial prototypes, I got enough support and feedback to jump into Photoshop and start designing.  Keeping with my goals of adding color without making it garish, I created comps I was satisfied with.

What we DID know was that it had to let users sign in and manage “sites” that they could build with tiles. There was also talk of implementing QR codes that would link to the site. With just that to go on, we started off creating use cases and primary noun architecture to workout what the admin section would need. This would be the basis of our design. After several thousand ideation meetings, we created a task flow that gave us and the stakeholder a better idea of what was needed and missing.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/hubtile/slide2.jpg\" alt=\"Balsalmiq wireframe of admin page\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">While there are MANY wireframes that we created for this application, this one is the core functionality of the application.

The obvious business goal is to display her writing talents, but there’s much more specific details involved in that. She needs to show particular writing skills and examples. She is also prefers traditional methods of writing, but that’s an aesthetic thing that will come in the visual design itself. We created this list of requirements.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                    <ul class=\"process-list\">\r\n                        <li>Must show diverse writing: newsletters, hosted articles, and downloadable PDFs.</li>\r\n                        <li>Must work on mobile and table for potential clients.</li>\r\n                        <li>It has to contain room for her to be able to discuss her skills at length while also providing a summary.</li>\r\n                        <li>Need to create a logo and branding.</li>\r\n                        <li>It has to have a lot of green. (Very important!)</li>\r\n                    </ul>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/foxworthy/slide2.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of whiteboard drawing of site layout\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">I decided to make this work like a single page application. This would allow the site to display all relevant info in one place. This would also allow potential clients to find everything they need without mucking about trying to find writing samples.  And also, if there was going to potentially be large files to load, so this would increase performance (load times) as well.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/foxworthy/slide3.jpg\" alt=\"Picture of whiteboard drawing of samples section\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">To display the diversity in her writing samples, I collected them all together and determined that they fell into 3 categories: Writing samples online as downloadable files (Downloads), Articles on external websites (External), and Newsletter emails (Internal). I deemed the Newsletters internal because I felt that it was best to just recreate them with HTML as opposed to taking a screen shot.  The accordion method lets the user see potentially many samples, but also giving them the option to hide them.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/foxworthy/slide4.jpg\" alt=\"Snippet of Amy Foxworthy.com website\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">After tweaking the wireframes a bit, I then started on the branding. Green was required so that was easy. Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters. I created the logo to resemble a typewriter key and included one on the logo itself.  I wanted the background to also be representative, just not too distracting so I placed a light black overlay on top of it.  This is the finished design.

I read several Tech HR articles to see what types of things they look for in designer and developer portfolios.  I also browsed a handful of interaction designer websites to see what others have done. </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/lawrence/slide4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">Once I had my design goals set up, it was time to get to work.

This would also allow potential clients to find everything they need without mucking about trying to find writing samples and also save on load times for mobile users.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/foxworthy/slide3.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">To display the diversity in her writing samples, I collected them all together and determined that they fell into 3 types. The accordion method lets the user see potentially many samples, but also gives them the option to hide them.\r\n                    </p>\r\n                </div>\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li class=\"slide\">\r\n                <img src=\"img/foxworthy/slide4.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"process-image\"/>\r\n                <div class=\"process-content\">\r\n                    <p class=\"process-text\">After tweaking the wireframes a bit, I then started on the branding. Green was required so that was easy. Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters.
