            <p>My first steps into the world of web development began in design. It started with my hobby of drawing, to evolving into graphic and print design, then to web and user interface design.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I have developed the habit of putting more work into conceptualizing the designs before I actually start on high fidelity stuff.</p>
            <p>Here’s some of my design work. I have included the entire process where I could.</p>

For an interaction design job, there were a couple business goals right off the bat that I know I needed to focus on. Some of them include:</p>
                                    <ul class="process-list">
                                        <li>My website must have interesting interaction elements.</li>

                                        <li>It must also work on mobile or tablet devices because I won’t know where the people I want to see my site will be when they view it.</li>
                                        <li>It has to have color (My last site was cool, but monochromatic).</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <p class="process-text">After creating my initial goals, I then did some research into a few relevant topics. This would be where I would create use cases for a design. I read several Tech HR articles to see what types of things they look for in designer and developer portfolios.  I also browsed a handful of interaction designer websites to see what others have done. After doing so I added these requirements to my list.</p>

                                        <li>Developed sites need links to live site as well as Github if applicable.</li>
                                        <li>Competition is stiff so focus on visual impressions as well as the informative aspects.</li>

With the clock ticking, I got out my paper and pencils are started sketching out some interaction concepts.

I also did not want to use a lightbox since they can be problematic. I opted to go with a hidden carousel since it would allow me to show and explain my process and also wouldn’t lock the user into one area. They would be free to close it or leave it open and continue browsing at their leisure. And of course, autoplay would NOT be used on the carousel.</p>

What we DID know was that it had to let users sign in and manage “sites” that they could build with tiles. There was also talk of implementing QR codes that would link to the site. With just that to go on, we started off creating use cases and primary noun architecture to workout what the admin section would need. This would be the basis of our design. After several thousand ideation meetings, we created a task flow that gave us and the stakeholder a better idea of what was needed and missing.

I deemed the Newsletters internal because I felt that it was best to just recreate them with HTML as opposed to taking a screen shot.  The accordion method lets the user see potentially many samples, but also giving them the option to hide them.

Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters. I created the logo to resemble a typewriter key and included one on the logo itself.  I wanted the background to also be representative, just not too distracting so I placed a light black overlay on top of it.  This is the finished design.

                                        <li>My website must have interesting interaction elements.</li>

                                        <li>It must also work on mobile or tablet devices because I won’t know where the people I want to see my site will be when they view it.</li>
                                        <li>It has to have color (My last site was cool, but monochromatic).</li>

This would be where I would create use cases for a design. I read several Tech HR articles to see what types of things they look for in designer and developer portfolios.  I also browsed a handful of interaction designer websites to see what others have done. After doing so I added these requirements to my list.</p>

                                    <p class="process-text">I settled on this layout because not only does it have creative interactive functionality, but it also would translate easy between desktop, tablet, and phone. It made room for showcasing both of my skillsets as well.</p>

They would be free to close it or leave it open and continue browsing at their leisure. And of course, autoplay would NOT be used on the carousel.</p>

What we DID know was that it had to let users sign in and manage “sites” that they could build with tiles. There was also talk of implementing QR codes that would link to the site. With just that to go on, we started off creating use cases and primary noun architecture to workout what the admin section would need. This would be the basis of our design. After several thousand ideation meetings, we created a task flow that gave us and the stakeholder a better idea of what was needed and missing.

Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters. I created the logo to resemble a typewriter key and included one on the logo itself.  I wanted the background to also be representative, just not too distracting so I placed a light black overlay on top of it.  This is the finished design.
