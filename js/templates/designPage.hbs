    <p>My first steps into the world of web development began in design. It started with my hobby of drawing, to evolving into graphic and print design, then to web and user interface design.</p>
    <p>Over the years, I have developed the habit of putting more work into conceptualizing the designs before I actually start on high fidelity stuff.</p>
    <p>Here’s some of my design work. I have included the entire process where I could.</p>

However, seeing this job posting for a position I really want meant that I needed to finish it sooner rather than later. Between balancing work, graduate studies, and sleep, I had to make time to design and code this project quickly.</p>

                    <p class="process-text">To start my portfolio projects, I like to create a set a design goals and post them somewhere where I can see them readily and often as I’m working. For an interaction design job, there were a couple business goals right off the bat that I know I needed to focus on. Some of them include:</p>
                    <ul class="process-list">
                        <li>My website must have interesting interaction elements.</li>
                        <li>I have the dual skillsets of being able to design and write code. I have to show these equally.</li>
                        <li>It must also work on mobile or tablet devices because I won’t know where the people I want to see my site will be when they view it.</li>
                        <li>It has to have color (My last site was cool, but monochromatic).</li>

                    <p class="process-text">After creating my initial goals, I then did some research into a few relevant topics. This would be where I would create use cases for a design. I read several Tech HR articles to see what types of things they look for in designer and developer portfolios.  I also browsed a handful of interaction designer websites to see what others have done. After doing so I added these requirements to my list.</p>
                    <ul class="process-list">
                        <li>Must show design process for several projects.</li>
                        <li>Developed sites need links to live site as well as Github if applicable.</li>
                        <li>Competition is stiff so focus on visual impressions as well as the informative aspects.</li>

                    <p class="process-text">Once I had my design goals set up, it was time to get to work. With the clock ticking, I got out my paper and pencils are started sketching out some interaction concepts.  I needed a good core interaction method that would be visually impressive, but not ridiculously superfluous.</p>
                    <p class="process-text">I settled on this layout because not only does it have creative interactive functionality, but it also would translate easy between desktop, tablet, and phone. It made room for showcasing both of my skillsets as well.</p>

                    <p class="process-text">For my design page, I wanted to make room to show all of my projects and the thought process behind as mentioned in my goals. I also did not want to use a lightbox since they can be problematic. I opted to go with a hidden carousel since it would allow me to show and explain my process and also wouldn’t lock the user into one area. They would be free to close it or leave it open and continue browsing at their leisure. And of course, autoplay would NOT be used on the carousel.</p>

What we DID know was that it had to let users sign in and manage “sites” that they could build with tiles. There was also talk of implementing QR codes that would link to the site. With just that to go on, we started off creating use cases and primary noun architecture to workout what the admin section would need. This would be the basis of our design. After several thousand ideation meetings, we created a task flow that gave us and the stakeholder a better idea of what was needed and missing.

The obvious business goal is to display her writing talents, but there’s much more specific details involved in that. She needs to show particular writing skills and examples. She is also prefers traditional methods of writing, but that’s an aesthetic thing that will come in the visual design itself. We created this list of requirements.

                    <p class="process-text">I decided to make this work like a single page application. This would allow the site to display all relevant info in one place. This would also allow potential clients to find everything they need without mucking about trying to find writing samples.  And also, if there was going to potentially be large files to load, so this would increase performance (load times) as well.

                    <p class="process-text">To display the diversity in her writing samples, I collected them all together and determined that they fell into 3 categories: Writing samples online as downloadable files (Downloads), Articles on external websites (External), and Newsletter emails (Internal). I deemed the Newsletters internal because I felt that it was best to just recreate them with HTML as opposed to taking a screen shot.  The accordion method lets the user see potentially many samples, but also giving them the option to hide them.

                    <p class="process-text">After tweaking the wireframes a bit, I then started on the branding. Green was required so that was easy. Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters. I created the logo to resemble a typewriter key and included one on the logo itself.  I wanted the background to also be representative, just not too distracting so I placed a light black overlay on top of it.  This is the finished design.

While my system doesn't address all facets of conversation, it does focus on emotion and levels of severity. Here's a list of functional requirements that I created from my research.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="process-list">
                        <li>Users should be able to attach nuances or opt to not attach them.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to lock the chat window during sessions.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to create custom nuances.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to assign colors to specific nuances.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to arrange top 10 nuances for quick access.</li>
                        <li>Users should be able to use hot keys as well as GUI.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="slide">
                <img src="img/emoe/slide2.jpg" alt="Design Space" class="process-image"/>
                <div class="process-content">
                    <p class="process-text">The main feature/goal of this application is to allow users to "attach" emotion, context, nuance, etc., to their messages before they send them. The senders meaning will be much easier to understand since it will be "received" as opposed to "perceived".
                    </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li class="slide">

                <div class="process-content">
                    <p class="process-text">Another feature of this application will be the ability to lock the conversation for a period of time. During my initial study, I found that some users find themselves in situations where they are trying to complete a long message. Often times, they are either interrupted before they finish or they have to submit a large block of text.  This locking feature will allow users to lock the chat window for up to 3 consecutive messages.  This aspect will have to be thoroughly test and tweaked to prevent it from being abused.
                    </p>

                <div class="process-content">
                    <p class="process-text">The challenge with this design was keeping the interface simple and familiar (matching traditional instant messaging interfaces), while adding a conceptually complex feature to express the nuances of conversation.<br /><br />To display the “emoes”, I opted to use colored circles. This keeps clutter down from the chat window and after a period of time, the colors can be readily identified with an emoe. The key that lets users know what the colors mean can be hidden, since two users who are familiar with each other’s colors would find it unnecessary and distracting.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="process-content">
                    <p class="process-text">Users will not only have default emoes to pick from, but they can also create their own and assign them a particular color. This feature was one of the main requested items in my initial survey.<br /><br />Also, when a user attaches an emoe to a message, they can adjust the “level” of it. The slider goes from “none” to “max”; none being completely black and max being the full hue of that color. Users can use this to express the amount of nuance they want to attach to their messages.

I read quite a few research papers from scientific journals to support my idea for this application. Here's a list of functional requirements that I created from my research.

                    <p class="process-text">The main feature/goal of this application is to allow users to "attach" emotion, context, nuance, etc., to their messages before they send them. The senders meaning will be much easier to understand since it will be "received" as opposed to "perceived".

                    <p class="process-text">Another feature of this application will be the ability to lock the conversation for a period of time. During my initial study, I found that some users find themselves in situations where they are trying to complete a long message. Often times, they are either interrupted before they finish or they have to submit a large block of text.

                    <p class="process-text">The challenge with this design was keeping the interface simple and familiar, while adding a conceptually complex feature to express the nuances of conversation.<br /><br />To display the “emoes”, I opted to use colored circles. This keeps clutter down from the chat window and the colors can be readily identified with an emoe.

                    <p class="process-text">Users will not only have default emoes to pick from, but they can also create their own and assign them a particular color.<br /><br />Also, when a user attaches an emoe to a message, they can adjust the “level” of it. Users can use this to express the amount of nuance they want to attach to their messages.
